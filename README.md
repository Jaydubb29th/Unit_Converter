# Unit_Converter
This was my second Python project. It converts units of length, mass, volume, and time. <br>
<hr><br>
In this project I practice making use of user inputs, variables, if/elif/else statements, dictionaries, lists, and functions. I manually input all of the conversion rates for each unit which was extremely time consuming. Hopefully, I can learn in a future project, methods of importing data with Python in order to make the programming process more efficient.
